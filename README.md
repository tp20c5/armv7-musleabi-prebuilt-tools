# ARMv7 Prebuilt Tools

Prebuilt small tools for ARMv7 (not ARMv7hf) devices, e.g. older ASUS routers.

This repository contains **precompiled binaries** of selected open-source tools
for ARMv7 devices that are often not provided upstream, or are only released for
ARMv7 hard-float (`armv7hf`) targets.  
Some binaries are compiled from source; others are taken from official releases
and stripped for smaller size.

> **Note:** All tools are licensed under their respective upstream licenses.
> This repository only redistributes compiled binaries for convenience.  
> Please check each project's LICENSE file for details.
